# PlanesTrivia
This project was made two years ago, and is an Android app made with the Java language, that quizzes a user on many topics concerning aviation.
The app was inspired by my interest in aviation and was a simple project that I could implement in Android Studio based on the knowledge that I had
gained at the time from my AP Computer Science A class.
The app is currently on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ajdevelopmentgroup.planestrivia
